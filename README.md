# Connect 4

Implementation of **Connect 4** board game

### Game rules

The Rules Are Simple

Connect 4 rules are easy to understand. In fact, it is in the name. To win Connect 4, all you have to do is connect 4 of your pieces in a row, much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one piece at a time. This will give you a chance to either build your row, or stop your opponent from getting 4 in a row.
